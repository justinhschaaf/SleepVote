# SleepVote

A Minecraft plugin which skips to day when enough players are sleeping.

## Non-Localization Config Options

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `sleep_percent` | `double` | The percentage of eligible players required to sleep before skipping to day. | `0.33` |
| `exempt_gamemodes` | `String[]` | The gamemodes a player can be in which exempts them from the sleep total. | `[creative, spectator]` |

## Why did you make this?

Yes, I know that there are other mods and probably plugins that do the same exact thing as this plugin. 
I guess I wanted a fun little project to make and to implement it in a way which is understandable to 
me and is lightweight (e.g. doesn't depend on Forge). In short, *because I can*.

## Where can I get it?

When there is a release, the best place to find it is probably under the GitHub "releases" tab. 
I may post it to CurseForge, too (eventually).

## Is there anything else I should know?

YES! If you're feeling generous, [you can give me money on Liberapay. Thank you for the support!](https://liberapay.com/justinhschaaf)
